I built this project to learn more about JavaScript modules, but along the way, I also gained a deeper understanding of arrays. I wanted to make this my best project so far, and I believe I’ve met those expectations. I use a to-do app on my phone, and I wanted this web app to have all the features that the one on my phone lacks.

You have a default todo list call “Todo list” in which the todos are save when you first open the app, but you can easily change that, you jus have to change the input in the Project input of the new todo form. This way is so much faster and  intuitive that with the New Project button, but hey you can use that one too if is more convenient for you.

In the form you also have a description input with plenty of space, that is not going to show in the main page unless you click on the details button, this way you can have a large description of your todo and that’s is not goin to be a problem in the display main page, everything is going to be clear because only the title is going to appear, a problem I have with the todo list in my phone that I wanted to solve.

The todos are shown in order, the first parameter to get into account is the priority, top priority is going to be shown first and low priority last, the second ones is date, the sooner the date the sooner the todo is shown.

You can edit all the values of the todos. Edit the projects names and which todo is inside which project. You can, of course, delete the projects and todos.

You can view all your todos together or you can view them by project and, if is easy for you, you can view them by priority, clicking in the colors traffic lights.
